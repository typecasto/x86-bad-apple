# x86-bad-apple
Bootable touhou meme. Project for operating systems SP2023.

# Setup
You need to do a bit of one-time setup before running, to generate the video data and install
tools that are required to run the OS.    
This only needs to be done once.
1. Make sure you have qemu-system-x86_64, ffmpeg, and rust installed.
2. Run `rustup target add x86_64-unknown-none`.
3. Run `rustup component add llvm-tools`.
4. In the `bad_apple_encoder` directory:
   1. Create a `frames` directory.
   2. Run `ffmpeg -i ../bad_apple.webm frames/frame_%d.png`
   3. Run `cargo run -r`
   4. Run `cp bad_apple.bin ../`

Complete! You should now be able to run `cargo r -r` in the main directory to run
the OS.
